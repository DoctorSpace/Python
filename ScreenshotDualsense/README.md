# Screenshot Dualsense with saving Adaptive Triggers

How to use:

1. Using python 3.10.9 <a  href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3109/"> Download </a>
2. Install Python (example "C:\Programs\Python")
3. Open cmd, and enter ```cd C:\Programs\Python\Scripts``` then ```pip install --upgrade pip```, dont close cmd
4. Add pygame ```pip install pygame```
5. Connect Dualsense
6. Run "Start.bat"
7. Click "Share" to take a screenshot in DualSense
8. Screenshots are saved to the Screenshot folder Dualsense\ScreenShots

Why is it needed:

When using the Steam Overlay or DSX, the Adaptive Triggers mode does not turn on in The Last of Us Part I. With this script, you can bypass this limitation and safely use adaptive triggers and conveniently take screenshots

With the <a  href="https://github.com/DoctorSpace/Python/tree/main/ImageToSteam"> ImageToSteam </a> script, you can quickly upload the resulting screenshots to Steam
